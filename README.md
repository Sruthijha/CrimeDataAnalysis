# ðŸ”Ž Analyzing Crime Trends and Patterns in the United States

This project presents a **comprehensive statistical analysis** of U.S. crime trends from **1979 to 2023** using data from the **FBI Crime Data Explorer**.  
The study explores long-term patterns, regional disparities, temporal anomalies, and predictive modeling of violent and property crimes.

## Features
- Cleaned and transformed FBI crime data (1979â€“2023)
- Normalization to per-100,000 population for fair comparisons
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) at national and state levels
- Visualizations of long-term crime trends and anomalies
- Statistical methods:  
  - Hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square)  
  - Outlier detection  
  - Bootstrapping for confidence intervals  
- Predictive modeling with **linear regression** to forecast crime rates up to 2033
- Insights into regional crime disparities and anomalies (e.g., 1990s crime spike, 2020 COVID disruptions)
